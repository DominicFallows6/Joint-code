The purpose of this module is to provide a different set of instructions on the checkout payment page for the Bank Transfer method. Magento currently displays the same payment instructions on the checkout payment page AND the email template. 

This module provides an additional text field in the admin area:

(Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods > Bank Transfer Payment > Instructions for Checkout Payment page.)

The information provided in this text field will be displayed on the frontend when you select to pay by bank transfer. 

The original "Instructions" text field is used to populate the email template with the actual payment details for bank transfer, i.e. bank account details, bank account sort code etc.
