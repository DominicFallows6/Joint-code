# Limitless Autocomplete

This module allows the an administrator to manually set the amount of autocomplete options returned in the search. It works as an override to the default M2 Controller Action for the autocomplete functionality.

The module comes with the following options:

Scope settings for _Default_ and _Site_ Level
The number of suggestions to be moved
Switch off the auto completion by using "0" value in the admin

The Admin portion of the site can be found at:

Stores -> Configuration -> Catalog -> Catalog -> Catalog Search -> [Autocomplete Result Count]

...the field is required to be a number and will default to "20" when the module is installed.

**Future Options**

Now we have our entry point, we could easily add:

* Different sorting options
* More information
* Product Images
